<h3><a name="funcionamientoTalleres" title="funcionamientoTalleres"></a>Funcionamiento del taller</h3>
	<p>During the workshop, ideas will be tested out and prototypes will be developed in interdisciplinary groups composed of all interested participants, coordinated by the project developer. The groups will be supported by tutors, and will have the space, equipment and materials necessary to develop each project. These must be requested in the initial proposal.</p>
	<p>
	In the workshop, we assume that free and open-source software will be used, that projects will be based on open standards and that the results will be available under licenses conducive to re-appropriation, reuse and distribution.
	</p><p>
	The workshop will be held in English and in Spanish, with no formal translation services offered. 
	</p><p>
	At the end of the workshop the resulting prototypes will be exposed for a time (to be determined) in Medialab Prado.
	</p>

<h3><a name="criterios" title="criterios">Project Evaluation Criteria  
</h3>	
	<ul>
		<li>Relevance to the general aims and themes of the call.</li>
		<li>Innovative and experimental in nature.</li>
		<li>Clarity of the proposal and suitability of the methodology and workshop development time (the aim is to produce a prototype by the end of the workshop. The proposal must therefore detail all parts of the project for which a prototype could be produced within the allotted period, and the parts for which this would be impossible.)</li>
		<li>Diversity in terms of approach and origin will be viewed positively, with consideration given to how the project fits in with the proposals to be selected as a whole.</li>
		<li>An introduction to the proposal that visits some inspiring or similar projects will be positively valued with a reasoned criticism of them from the perspective of the project that is now proposed. This is not a mandatory requirement, but it is advisable. It will also provide very useful information on the context to all project partners.</li>
		<li>Adaptations of other projects, hacks, reinventions, etc. can be presented. The originality of the approach or the improvements over the original project and its capacity to achieve the objectives will be evaluated.</li>
