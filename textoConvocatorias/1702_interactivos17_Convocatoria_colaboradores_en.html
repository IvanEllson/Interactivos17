<h3><a name="acerca" title="acerca"></a>About this call</h3>
	<p>Medialab-Prado publishes a call for all those interested in participating in the workshop<a href="http://medialab-prado.es/article/interactivos17">Interactivos?'17</a> as a collaborator in one of the workgroups that will develop the selected projects.</p>
	<p>
	The collaborator is basic in the planning and development of the workshops at Medialab-Prado, thus these are conceived as spaces for collaborative work, knowledge exchange and theoretical and practical training. It is an environment in which there is an horizontal relationship among mentors, developers and the collaborators.
	</p>
	<p>According to its field of interest, each collaborator can be part of the development team in more than one of the selected proposals bringing his/her knowledge and ideas to the workgroup and, at the same time, learning from the group and the mentors. However, we suggest that employees focus on a proposal to ensure greater commitment with it during all phases of the workshop.</p>
	<p>As it is specified in the rules, the names of the collaborators will appear in the project’s credits. Also, Medialab-Prado will give a document certifying the participation in the workshop to all the participants that request it. </p>
	<p>The workshop runs from Monday to Saturday from May 17 to 31, 2016. Timetable will be from 10am to 6:30pm with a break for lunch. Somedays after 6:30pm there will be little workshops and presentations until 8:30pm.</p>
