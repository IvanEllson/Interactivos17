<h3><a name="funcionamientoTalleres" title="funcionamientoTalleres"></a>Operation of the workshop</h3>
<p>
	<p>During the workshop, ideas will be tested out and prototypes will be developed in interdisciplinary groups composed of all interested participants, coordinated by the project developer. The groups will be supported by tutors, and will have the space, equipment and materials necessary to develop each project. These must be requested in the initial proposal.</p>
	<p>
	In the workshop, we assume that free and open-source software will be used, that projects will be based on open standards and that the results will be available under licenses conducive to re-appropriation, reuse and distribution.
	</p><p>
	The workshop will be held in English and in Spanish, with no formal translation services offered. 
	</p><p>
	At the end of the workshop the resulting prototypes will be exposed for a time (to be determined) in Medialab Prado.
	</p>


<br/>
<h3><a name="compromisos" title="compromisos">Obligations of selected parties</h3>
<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Selected individuals or groups undertake to attend all days of the workshop</li>
		<li>Furthermore, selected parties undertake to finish and appropriately document the proposed projects.</li>
		<li>The projects submitted must be open to and promote the participation of interested persons.</li>
		<li>Basic information on the projects, in regard to the process as well as the outcome, shall be recorded in open/free platforms (such as the Medialab-Prado collaborative work platform at http://comunidad.medialab-prado.es/ or GitHub if open access is guaranted, etc).</li>
		<li>All documentation will be published under a <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contenido_libre">free license</a>that allow its own reuse. </li>
		<li>Similarly, participants shall include their code in a repository accessible to the public and publish it under an open-source license enabling reuse thereof. During the workshop, support with documentation shall be provided. </li>
		<li>Project credits shall list the participation of each member of the team and their role within the workshop.</li>
		<li>The organisation encourages and supports the use of open-source programs for the purpose of developing the projects.</li>

<br/>
<h3><a name="criterios" title="criterios">Project evaluation criteria  
</h3>	
	<ul>
		<li>Relevance to the general aims and themes of the call.</li>
		<li>Innovative and experimental in nature.</li>
		<li>Clarity of the proposal and suitability of the methodology and workshop development time (the aim is to produce a prototype by the end of the workshop. The proposal must therefore detail all parts of the project for which a prototype could be produced within the allotted period, and the parts for which this would be impossible.)</li>
		<li>Diversity in terms of approach and origin will be viewed positively, with consideration given to how the project fits in with the proposals to be selected as a whole.</li>
		<li>An introduction to the proposal that visits some inspiring or similar projects with a reasoned criticism from the perspective of the current proposal will be positively valued. This is not a mandatory requirement, but it is advisable. It will also provide very useful contextual information to all project partners.</li>
		<li>Adaptations of other projects, hacks, reinventions, etc. can be presented. The originality of the approach or the improvements over the original project and its capacity to achieve the objectives will be evaluated.</li>

	</ul>
