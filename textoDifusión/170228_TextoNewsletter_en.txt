Interactivos?'17 - Re-imagining movement in the city: citizen science for a sustainable present

Medialab-Prado (Madrid) is launching an open call for the submission of projects and research articles for the international collaborative prototyping seminar and workshop to be held in Madrid from 17 to 31 May 2017. As a theme, Interactivos?â€™17 suggests mobility in the city (living beings, material goods, pollutants, etc) on the intersection of three wide perspectives: citizen science, environmental sustainability and creativity and art with digital tools.

What do the workshops consist of? 

Interactivos? is a research and production platform for the creative and educational uses of technology. Its main goal is to expand on the use of electronic and software tools for artists, designers and educators, thus contributing to the development of local communities of cultural producers in this field.

Interactivos? events are a hybrid between an international production workshop, a seminar and a showcase. After the first days of seminar, projects promoters and collaborators work together to develop the proposed prototypes. Then these prototypes are showcased in a public exhibition in Medialab-Prado. Thus a space for reflection, research, and collaborative work is created. The process is open to the public from beginning to end.
